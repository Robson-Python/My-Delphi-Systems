# My Delphi Systems
Repository with some applications developed by me in Delphi/Pascal with several Databases

1 - Backup Utility - Utility for creating/restoring backups. I developed and use this little application with my systems..

2 - Bovine Management System - I developed this system in partnership with a farmer. The objective of this system is to manage the cattle pasture and confinement sector, controlling the cost of feed for fattening cattle, among other management tasks. This system was also challenging, as it required numerous mathematical calculations.

3 - GloboGuia was my first mobile app. The purpose of this app is to create a contact list of all companies in different sectors in different regions for general user inquiries.

4 - MyCar - Car maintenance management and control system. This was practically my first software project. As I am passionate about cars, I decided to create this system to be able to take care of vehicle inspections, insurance, and fuel consumption. Some time later, I improved the first version and was able to update it to also manage fleets.

5 - MyContatos - I developed this system in partnership with an authorized Honda motorcycle store. The purpose of this software is to manage sales and monitor motorcycle inspections, as well as auditing the service so that it is performed within the timeframe stipulated by the store. This system is still being used by this store today.

6 - MyShop is a commercial application system for controlling sales and service provision. It controls product input, output and also service orders executed by the company.

7 - Log Management - I developed this application in partnership with a local lumber mill. It was a very challenging system. It was one of the first ones I developed and it required a lot of mathematical calculations. This software controls the entry and exit of logs. Along with it, a warehouse system was also developed that was created separately, but for the same lumber mill.

8 - Video Rental System - I developed this application when I worked at a CD rental store. It controls rentals, reservations, movie purchases, and customer debits and rentals, as well as having built-in sales control.

All of these systems were developed by me, throughout my career. I developed these systems between 2006 and 2018 and I always worked as a freelancer. This is my legacy that I share with everyone here on Github.
